# ðŸ”Œ HyProxy
HyProxy is a proxy that boosts your Hypixel experience by adding new features like custom commands, in-game user statistics and more!

## âš™ How to install
Simply go to [the latest release](https://github.com/MauritsWilke/HyProxy/releases/latest) and download the executable for your OS.\
`Note: this program may be flagged as a virus, this is because the executable is not signed`

After installing just run the executable, this should spawn a terminal asking for your email and password linked with your account.\
`Note: this will create a config.json in the same folder as the program`

After logging in, the terminal will say ` > Proxy has been started.` after which you can connect to it by connecting to localhost in Minecraft.

`Note: you can also add localhost as a server, it should look exactly like Hypixel`
