# ðŸ”Œ HyProxy

> If you like Hypixel proxies, I suggest you check out [P28](https://github.com/mauritsWilke/P28) which is a more updated and better programmed Hypixel proxy!

HyProxy is a proxy that boosts your Hypixel experience by adding new features like custom commands, in-game user statistics and more!

## âš™ How to install
Simply go to [the latest release](https://github.com/MauritsWilke/HyProxy/releases/latest) and download the executable for your OS.\
This program may be flagged as a virus, this is because the executable is not officially signed.
If you want to be completely sure, use [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url) to scan the file!

After installing just run the executable, this should spawn a terminal asking for your email and password linked with your account. This will create a HyProxyConfig.json in the same folder as the program which can be used to customise the appearance of the application.

When you successfully logged in, the terminal will say ` > Proxy has been started.` after which you can connect to it by connecting to localhost in Minecraft.\
If you want to, you can even add localhost to your server list! It'll show up exactly the same as Hypixel!

## âœ” Custom commands
`This feature is still very much Work in Progress`\
HyProxy supports custom commands by having a `modules` folder in the same location as the executable.
This repository has an example `modules` folder that you can use to create your own commands.
